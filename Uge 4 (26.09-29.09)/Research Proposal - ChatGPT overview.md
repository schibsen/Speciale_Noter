**Title: Towards Generalized Face Manipulation Detection - with Focus on Physical and Digital Impersonation Attacks**

**1. Motivation/Project Description:**

Face recognition technology has become a fundamental component of modern security systems, playing a crucial role in applications such as border control, airport security, device access, and identity verification. The widespread adoption of Automatic Face Recognition (AFR) systems has made it imperative to ensure the security and robustness of these systems. One of the most pressing challenges facing AFR systems is the detection and mitigation of various types of attacks.

Over the years, significant efforts have been made to develop methods for detecting attacks on AFR systems. These attacks can broadly be categorized into three domains: Presentation or Physical Attacks, Digital Attacks, and Adversarial Attacks. Presentation attacks involve the use of physical objects, such as masks or photos, to impersonate someone else. Digital attacks encompass manipulations of digital images and videos to deceive AFR systems. Adversarial attacks involve the deliberate modification of input data to mislead the recognition process.

Within each of these domains, numerous attack types and manifestations exist. For example, in the physical domain, one attack type is the use of 3D masks, with various manifestations like transparent silicone masks and standard silicone masks. Understanding the relationships between attack domains, attack types, and their manifestations is crucial for developing effective detection methods, as illustrated in Figure 1.

While research has made significant progress in the development of attack detection methods, most early work focused on a single domain, making them less effective in generalizing to previously unseen attacks, especially those originating from other domains. As a result, recent research efforts have shifted towards enhancing the generalization capabilities of AFR attack detection, aiming to cover two or all three attack domains and address emerging threats that were not previously encountered.

In recent years, the field of attack detection has seen a notable shift toward the adoption of Anomaly Detection, often referred to as One-Class Classification. This innovative approach trains a model to learn the intrinsic variations within legitimate facial images, enabling it to identify deviations from these learned patterns as anomalies, potentially indicating face manipulations. While early implementations of this approach may not have demonstrated significant improvements in detecting well-known attacks, they have shown remarkable promise in detecting previously unseen and unknown attacks.

This promising trend forms the backdrop for our proposed research project, which seeks to investigate and enhance the generalization capabilities of attack detection methods within the realm of face recognition. Our primary objective is to develop advanced versions of some of the state-of-the-art attack detection methods. To achieve this, our research will entail the development of novel detection techniques. Initially, our goal will be to attain a performance level on par with existing attack detection methods. Subsequently, we aim to surpass these benchmarks by incorporating attention mechanisms or refining the anomaly detection methodology.

# input to the prompt 
Many security systems today rely on Face Recognition as a cornerstone for safeguarding various domains, including border control, airport security, device access, and more. 
It is, therefore, of utmost importance to ensure that the Automatic Face Recognition(AFR) systems used in these scenarios are secure and robust. 

The Detection of attacks has, therefore, been a significant topic in research, leading to the development of numerous detection methods. \[cite some detection methods\]
Attacks on AFR systems face attacks across three domains: Presentation or Physical Attacks, Digital Attacks and Adversarial Attacks. 

Within each of these domains, multiple attack types manifest. 
For instance, in the physical Domain, an attack type is 3D Masks. 
Each attack type can have several manifestations; for the 3D mask, one is a transparent silicone mask, and another is a standard silicone mask. 
Figure 1 shows the connection between attack domains, attack types, and their manifestations.

Most of the early work on Attack Detection in AFR systems focused on a single domain, resulting in them generalising poorly to unseen attacks, especially those from other domains. Consequently, recent research shifted towards developing better generalisation capabilities, spanning two or all three attack domains and previously unseen attacks. 

Recently the idea of Anomaly detection sometimes referred to as  One class classification has come up as attack detection method, where one part of the model is trained on learning the intra-variation of faces and thereby detecting face manipulations as these show up as anomalies. Although in the beginning these did not show improvement for the known attacks, they did show improvement on detection for unknown attacks. 

Due to these factors the proposed project will investigate the generalization capabilties of attack detection methods, by creating more advanced versions of some of the state-of-the-art methods. In order to do this a number of detection methods need to be developed, the first goal beeing to reach the performance of existing attack detection methods, the next goal being to beat these methods by adding either attention mechanisms or improving the anomaly detection method
