# Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN)
**Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN)** is a framework developed for both face detection and face alignment.
It consists of three stages of convolutional networks that can recognize faces and landmark locations such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
MTCNN adopts a cascaded structure with carefully designed deep convolutional networks to predict face and landmark locations in a coarse-to-fine manner.
It has achieved superior accuracy on challenging benchmarks for face detection, face alignment, and landmark detection.

MTCNN utilizes the inherent correlation between face detection and alignment to boost their performance.
In the learning process, MTCNN also employs an online hard sample mining strategy to improve performance automatically without manual sample selection.

MTCNN consists of three stages of convolutional networks that are able to recognize faces and landmark locations such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
1. The first stage, known as the **Proposal Network (P-Net)**, generates a set of candidate bounding boxes that may contain a face.
2. The second stage, called the **Refine Network (R-Net)**, refines the bounding box proposals generated by the P-Net.
3. Finally, the third stage, known as the **Output Network (O-Net)**, further refines the bounding box proposals and predicts facial landmarks.
