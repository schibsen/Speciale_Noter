When we talk about ensemble method, we refer to the way how we fuse the information of different classifiers or regression methods. 

SOme of the most common ones are listed below

# Cascade
Ensemble learning based on the concatenation of several classifiers². 
In this method, the output from one classifier is used as additional information for the next classifier in the cascade.
- Unlike voting or stacking ensembles, which are multi-expert systems, cascading is a multistage process².

- Cascading classifiers are commonly used in image processing for object detection and tracking, particularly for facial detection and recognition.
- The first cascading classifier was developed by [[Viola-Jones object Detection|Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001 for face detection]]. The goal was to create a fast classifier that could be implemented on low-power CPUs, such as cameras and phones².
