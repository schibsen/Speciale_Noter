In the context of **neural networks**, a **cascaded structure** refers to a **hierarchical arrangement of multiple layers or modules, where the output of one layer or module serves as the input to the next layer or module**.

The cascaded structure allows for a step-by-step processing of the input data, with each layer or module learning increasingly complex representations or features.

Cascaded structures are commonly used in various neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling.

In CNNs, for example, the cascaded structure typically consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by one or more fully connected layers.
Each convolutional layer learns to extract different levels of features from the input image, while the fully connected layers combine these features to make predictionsÂ².

The cascaded structure allows neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of the input data, capturing both low-level and high-level features. By progressively refining the representations through multiple layers or modules, cascaded structures enable neural networks to achieve higher levels of abstraction and better performance on complex tasks.
