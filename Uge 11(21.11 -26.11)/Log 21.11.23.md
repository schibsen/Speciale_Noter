# goal for today 
- [ ] identify the models for the benchmarking 


## things i should remember
- [ ] that the model backbones should be trained on the same datasets
- [ ] that the facerecognition is also trained on the same dataset 


# Models on official sites 

1. [serengil/deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
2. [deepinsight/insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)
