# Background on Facial recognition
- where is it used
- why is it used ? i.e. non.inasive compaed to other biometric systems

# Motivation for MAD 
- with growing use of AFR systems comes greater interest in fooling these
- methods get more advanced with the improvements in the AI world
- counte research is needed
### Relevant sources 
- [3,4] [[OneClass]]
# Motivation for generalization 
- well working MAD exist for specific attacks or specific domains, however trouble of generalizing well to unseen attacks and to other domains

## Physical and Digital 
- what my original goal was to focus on 
## Digital and adversarial 

# Related work all three 
- argue that adversarial and the two other domains are tofar apart to make a unified framework, instead one would need an ensemble method for this. as has been doen in [[SPL-MAD]]
