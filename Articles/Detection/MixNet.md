# Title
Title: MixNet for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection

# Summary
In this research, we propose a deep learning-based network that can detect presentation attacks in cross-database and unseen attack settings. Our algorithm utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures and learns the feature mapping for each attack category. With this, we hope to improve the reliability of face recognition algorithms and enhance their successful deployment across multiple applications.

Key insights and lessons learned: 
- Existing presentation attack detection algorithms are not reliable against multiple attacks in both seen and unseen settings. 
- MixNet can detect and classify different types of attacks, with the major challenge being detecting mask attacks. 
- The proposed algorithm can improve the reliability of face recognition in mobile unlocking and digital payments. 
- The SMAD and SiW-M databases were used in the experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Suggestions for future research: 
1. Investigate the use of MixNet for presentation attack detection in other biometric recognition systems. 
2. Explore the use of MixNet in real-time scenarios and evaluate its performance. 
3. Investigate the use of MixNet for detecting adversarial attacks in face recognition systems. 
4. Develop new presentation attack databases to evaluate the efficacy of presentation attack detection algorithms. 
5. Investigate the use of other machine learning techniques for presentation attack detection, such as anomaly detection and decision trees.

How MixNet differs from exisiting PAD algorithms ? 
MixNet differs from existing presentation attack detection algorithms in that it can detect presentation attacks in cross-database and unseen attack settings, and it utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures to learn the feature mapping for each attack category. Additionally, MixNet adds an intermediate step of detecting the three broad attacks before the final classification of genuine/attack, which makes it more effective in detecting different types of attacks.
