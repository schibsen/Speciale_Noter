**Datasets**:
- All of our experiments are performed on 3 public benchmark datasets for forgery detection, i.e., CASIA v1.0 [8], CASIA v2.0 [8] and Columbia gray DVMM [23]. 
- The CASIA v1.0 dataset contains 1,725 color images of size 384√ó256 pixels in JPEG format, among which, 925 are forged images generated by pasting the cropped image regions processed by resizing, rotation or deformation.
- The CASIA v2.0 database is more challenging for introducing post-processing on boundary area of tampered regions. It contains 7,491 authentic and 5,123 forged color images with size ranging from 240√ó160 to 900√ó600 pixels in JPEG, BMP and TIFF formats.
- Both CASIA v1.0 and v2.0 contain splicing and copy-move forged images. 
- The DVMM dataset consists of 933 authentic images and 912 spliced images of size 128√ó128 pixels without any post-processing.

**Motivation(if relevant)**
- In recent years, deep neural networks, such as Deep Belief Network [9], Deep Auto Encoder [10] and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [11], have shown to be capable of extracting complex statistical dependencies from high-dimensional sensory inputs and efficiently learning their hierarchical representations, allowing it to generalize well across a wide variety of computer vision (CV) tasks, including image classification [12], speech recognition [13], and etc.
- More recently, the deep learning based approach has also found applications in passive image forensics. In [14], a CNN model was trained for median filtering detection. 
- However, Ying et al. [15] showed that the conventional deep learning framework may not be directly applied to image tampering detection, this because, with elaborated designed tools, the forgery images tend to closely resemble the authentic ones not only visually but also statistically. Therefore, they adopted the wavelet features of images as input of their deep autoencoder.
- Bayar et al. [16] proposed a new convolutional layer in their CNN model to learn prediction error filters with constraint to discover the traces left by image manipulations
**Proposal(brief)**:
- a new image forgery detection method based on deep learning technique, which utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn hierarchical representations from the input RGB color images.
- The proposed CNN is specifically designed for image splicing and copy-move detection applications.
- the weights at the first layer of our network are initialized with the basic high-pass filter set used in calculation of residual maps in spatial rich model (SRM), which serves as a regularizer to efficiently suppress the effect of image contents and capture the subtle artifacts introduced by the tampering operations.
- The pre-trained CNN is used as patch descriptor to extract dense features from the test images, and a feature fusion technique is then explored to obtain the final discriminative features for SVM classification.
**Method(long)**:
- The primary contributions are summarized as follows:
1. We first train a supervised CNN to **learn the hierarchical features of tampering operations (splicing and copy-move) with labeled patches (ùëù√óùëù) from the training images**.
    The first convolutional layer of the CNN serves as the pre-processing module to efficiently suppress the effect of image contents. Instead of the random strategy, the kernel weights of the first layer are initialized with the 30 basic high-pass filters used in calculation of residual maps in spatial rich model (SRM) [17], which helps to improve the generalization ability and accelerate the convergence of the network.
2. We then extract the features for an image with the pre-trained CNN on the basis of ùëù√óùëù patch by applying a patch-sized sliding-window to scan the whole image. The generated image representation is then condensed by a simple feature fusion technique, i.e. regional pooling, to obtain the final discriminative feature.
3. Finally, a SVM classifier is trained based on the resulting feature representation for binary classification (authentic/forged). The experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform some state-of-the-art methods.

- The proposed method consists of two major steps, i.e., feature learning and feature extraction.
- **In the first step**, we pretrain a CNN model based on the labelled patch samples from the training images. 
	- The positive patch samples are elaborately drawn along the boundaries of the tampered regions in forged images, i.e., the boundaries of splicing and cloned patches, while the negative ones are randomly sampled from the authentic images. 
	- In this way, the CNN could concentrate on the local artifacts due to tampering operations and learn a hierarchical representation for the forged image.
- **In the second step**, the pre-trained CNN is used to extract the patch-based features for an image by applying a patch-sized sliding window to scan the whole image.
	- The patch-based features are aggregated through feature fusion to obtain the discriminate feature for an image, which is then used to train the SVM for image forgery detection.

- Shi et al. [3] proposed a natural image model for image splicing detection.
	- He et al. [4] improved the method in [3] by resorting to a causal Markov model applied in both DCT and DWT (discrete wavelet transform) domains, and using the cross-domain features to train a SVM classifier
	- r. In [5], Zhao et al. further developed a 2-D noncausal Markov model to characterize the underlying image dependency and achieved splicing localization.
- , Lyu et al. [6] proposed an alternative approach to detect and localize the splicing images by revealing the inconsistencies of local noises due to camera sensors or post-processing.
- Inspired by the fact that image tampering may alter the texture micro-patterns in an image, local binary pattern (LBP) and steerable pyramid transform (SPT) were employed in [7] to detect the distortions of textural properties in forged images and achieved so far the state-ofthe-art detection performance on CASIA dataset [8].
