Title:  Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions

# Summary 

In this paper, we introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture that outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset.

This article presents a deep learning architecture known as Xception, which is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
Xception is based on the idea of **using depthwise separable convolutions**, which are a factorized version of standard convolutions.

1. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Xception replaces traditional convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions in its building blocks. Depthwise separable convolutions consist of two main operations: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions. This factorization significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity while maintaining expressive power.
    
2. **Inception-inspired Modules**: Xception's architecture is inspired by Google's Inception modules, which use multiple filter sizes in parallel to capture features at different scales. Xception extends this concept by applying depthwise separable convolutions within the modules.

3. **Improved Performance**: Xception achieves state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, while being computationally efficient. It often outperforms previous architectures with a similar number of parameters.

4. **Scalability**: Xception can be scaled up or down by adjusting the number of layers and filters, making it adaptable to different tasks and computational resources.

5. **Applications**: Xception has been widely used in various computer vision applications and serves as a strong baseline for many deep learning tasks.

The Inception hypothesis 
The Inception hypothesis is the fundamental hypothesis behind the Inception module used in the Inception V3 architecture. The hypothesis is that **cross-channel correlations and spatial correlations are sufficiently decoupled that it is preferable not to map them jointly**.

The typical Inception module first looks at cross-channel correlations via a set of 1x1 convolutions, mapping the input data into 3 or 4 separate spaces that are smaller than the original input space, and then maps all correlations in these smaller 3D spaces, via regular 3x3 or 5x5 convolutions. 

This process makes the convolutional neural network more efficient by explicitly factoring it into a series of operations that would independently look at cross-channel correlations and at spatial correlations.

Improvemnent to the Inception model 
we suggest that it may be possible to improve upon the Inception family of architectures by replacing Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions, i.e. by building models that would be stacks of depthwise separable convolutions

Conclusion 
The authors claim also claim that the depthwise separable convolution operation is a powerful building block for deep neural networks and that the residual connections help with convergence and final classification performance. Finally, the authors suggest that the Xception architecture could be used as a drop-in replacement for other convolutional neural network architectures in various computer vision tasks.
