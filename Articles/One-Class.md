Title: Learning One Class Representations for Face Presentation Attack Detection using Multi-channel Convolutional Neural Networks

Code and protocols: https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.paper.oneclass_mccnn_2019
# Summary 
Proposal: 
- a one-class classifier based framework
- the feature representation is learned with a CNN to have discriminative properties. 
- the core is a multi-channel CNN trained to learn the embedding using a specific loss function. 

Aim: 
- to learn a compact representation for the bona fide class while leveraging the discriminative information for PAD task. 

Main Contributions: 
- a novel multi-channel one-class classifier-based approach is proposed for unseen attack detection
- a novel loss function is proposed which learns a compact and discriminative representation of the face for PAD task, leveraging the information provided from known attacks.
