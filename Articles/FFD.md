# Summary
Proposal
- Instead of simply using multi-task learning to simultaneously detect manipulated images and predict the manipulated mask (regions), we propose to utilize an attention mechanism to process and improve the feature maps for the classification task
- the learned attention maps highlight the informative regions to further improve the binary classification(genuine face v. fake face), and also visualize the manipulated regions
