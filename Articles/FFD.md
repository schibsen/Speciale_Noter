# Summary
Proposal
- Instead of simply using multi-task learning to simultaneously detect manipulated images and predict the manipulated mask (regions), we propose to utilize an attention mechanism to process and improve the feature maps for the classification task
- the learned attention maps highlight the informative regions to further improve the binary classification(genuine face v. fake face), and also visualize the manipulated regions

Three main types of facial forgery attacks 
1. Physical spoofing
	- face printed on a paper
	- replaying image/video on a phone 
	- 3D mask 
	- [8,24,34,35]
2. Adversarial face attacks
- evade automated face matchers
- [18,20,37,57]
3. Digital Manipulation attacks 
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- entirely or partially modified photorealistic face images. 

Four categories of Digital face manipulation 
1. expression swap
- 3D face reconstruction and animation methods 
- [17,32,48,64]
- Face2Face [47]
2. identity swap
- FaceSwap [47.53]
- DeepFakes
3. attribute manipulation
- edits gender, age skin color, hair and glasses
- image translation is done via the adversarial framework of GANs [23,62,63]
- same for manipulation in a given context [10,45]
- FaceApp [4], 28 filters to modify specific attributes
4. entire face synthesis 
- GANs
- [15,25,26]

Dataset
- Diverse Fake Face Dataset [[Datasets/DFFD]]
- 2.6 million images from all four categories 


Assumption
- a well-learned network would gather different information spatially in order to detect manipulated faces 
Hypothesis 
- thus correctly estimating this spatial information can enable the network to focus on these important spatial regions to make its decision. 
- thereby locating the manipulated regions by estimating an image-specific attention map

Quantification / Metrics 
- a novel metric for attention map accuracy evaluation

Anticipation
- that the predicted attention maps for manipulated face images and videos would reveal hints about the type, magnitude and even intention of the manipulation. 

Contributions
- A comprehensive fake face dataset including 0.8M real and 1.6M fake faces generated by a diverse set of face modification methods and an accompanying evaluation protocol
- a novel attention-based layer to improve classification performance and produce an attention map indicating the manipulated facial regions 
- A novel metric, termed Inverse Intersection Non-Containment (IINC) for evaluating attention maps that produces a more coherent evaluation than existing metrics.
- SOTA performance of digital facial forgery detection for both seen and unseen manipulation methods
