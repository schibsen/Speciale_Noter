# B
### Bi-class classifiers
these classifiers are trained on both *bona fide presentations* (BPs) and attack presentations
# M
### Morphing attack 
*A morphing attack is a face image which is purposefully manipulated to be matched with the probe images of more than one identity*  \[[[SPL-MAD]]\]


# O 
### One-class classifiers
these classifiers are only trained on *bona fide presentations*, an image is then evaluated based on whether it is an anomaly or not. 
Examples are 
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Single-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (SO-GAAL)
