# ISO/IEC 301073

### Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER)

The proportion of attack samples misclassified as bona fides
### Bona fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER)

the proportion of bona fide samples misclassied as attacks. 

# Other 
### Equal error rate (EER)
the value where APCER=BPCER

### Detection Equal Error Rate (D-EER)
the point where APCER and BPCER are equal



# Visual evaluation 

### Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves
curves between APCER and BPCER

### receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves
the x-axis is APCER and the y- axis is (1-BPCER) at different points.
