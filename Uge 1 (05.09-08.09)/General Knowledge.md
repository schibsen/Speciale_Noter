### Convolutional autoencoders (CAE)
Cite: [[SPL-MAD]]
Autoencoder(AE) is a branch of unsupervised learning techniques and has been widely used for anomaly detection. 
AE consists of an encoder representing the input in a latent domain and a decoder reconstructing the data from this latent feature. 
Convolutional autoencoder(CAE) is designed by stacking convolutional layers, where the encoder is combined by several convolutional layers and the decoder is combined by transposed convolutional layers.
