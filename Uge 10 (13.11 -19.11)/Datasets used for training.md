# MS1M 

The MS1M dataset is a large-scale face recognition dataset that has been used to train many state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms [^1]. It contains 10 million images of 100,000 individuals, making it one of the largest publicly available face datasets [^1]. The images are collected from the Internet and are labeled with the corresponding identity information [^1]. The dataset is challenging due to the large number of identities and the high degree of intra-class variations [^1].

The MS1M dataset is a subset of the MS-Celeb-1M dataset, which is a larger dataset containing 1 million identities and 10 million images [^2]. The MS-Celeb-1M dataset has been criticized for containing a large number of mislabeled images [^1]. To address this issue, a cleaned version of the dataset, called C-MS-Celeb, has been released [^1]. The C-MS-Celeb dataset contains 6.5 million images of 94,682 celebrities and is considered to be a more reliable dataset for training face recognition models [^1].
