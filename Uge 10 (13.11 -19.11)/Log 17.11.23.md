Images where no faces are deteected and why that is the case 

1. `043289_7M54.JPG`  : in this case the person on the photo has the eye half closed 
2. `077972_0M40.JPG`  : Maybe because the face starts outside the picture , i.e. left side and down side starts inside gface, no contours
3. `276849_00M20.JPG`: as the above image the face starts outside the image, here the upper and lower side start inside the face. 
4. `276849_00M20.JPG`: same as the above images. Just in this case it is all 4 sides.
